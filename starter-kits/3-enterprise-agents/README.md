#### What You Must NOT Include:

- ❌ Microsoft 365 credentials, access tokens, or tenant IDs
- ❌ Azure API keys, connection strings, or secrets
- ❌ Customer data or personally identifiable information (PII)
- ❌ Confidential or proprietary company information
- ❌ Internal business processes or sensitive organizational data
- ❌ Real production configurations or internal system details

### Enterprise Security Best Practices

Security is paramount when building enterprise agents that handle sensitive organizational data and integrate with Microsoft 365 services. When writing custom code, follow these guidelines to ensure your solution meets enterprise security standards:

#### Microsoft 365 Security Integration

- **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)**: Your agent **must** leverage Microsoft Entra ID for user authentication and authorization. This ensures that users are properly authenticated before accessing agent capabilities and that authorization policies are enforced consistently across the enterprise.

- **User Authentication**: Implement proper authentication flows that require users to sign in with their organizational credentials. Use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols to securely authenticate users and obtain access tokens for downstream API calls.

- **Authorization & Permissions**: Define granular permissions for your agent based on the principle of least privilege. Ensure that users can only access data and perform actions that are appropriate for their role and responsibilities within the organization.

- **Conditional Access Policies**: Design your agent to respect organizational Conditional Access policies, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, device compliance checks, and location-based access controls.

#### Secret Management for Microsoft 365 Agents

✅ **Never commit credentials** - Use secure credential storage:

```bash
# .env (add to .gitignore immediately!)
MICROSOFT_APP_ID=your-app-id
MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

✅ **Use Azure Key Vault** - Store secrets in Azure Key Vault for production deployments

✅ **Environment-specific configs** - Maintain separate configurations for dev/test/production

✅ **Review `.gitignore`** - Ensure these patterns are included:

```gitignore
.env
.env.*
appsettings.json
appsettings.*.json
*.user
**/.secrets/
config/secrets.*
*.pem
*.pfx
*.key
```

#### Data Protection & Privacy

- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard protocols (TLS 1.2+)
- **Minimize Data Storage**: Avoid storing unnecessary data; process and discard when possible
- **Data Residency**: Respect organizational data residency and sovereignty requirements
- **GDPR/Compliance**: Ensure your agent complies with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

#### Secure Development Practices

- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent XSS and other vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct security-focused code reviews before deployment
- **Audit & Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging to track agent interactions without exposing sensitive information
- **Token Management**: Store and handle access tokens securely; never expose tokens in logs, URLs, or client-side code

#### Responsible AI for Enterprise Agents

- **Content Filters**: Implement content filtering to prevent inappropriate responses
- **Bias Testing**: Test for and mitigate biases in agent responses
- **Transparency**: Clearly indicate to users when they're interacting with AI
- **Human Oversight**: Include escalation paths for complex or sensitive scenarios
- **Explainability**: Provide mechanisms to explain agent decisions when needed

### Core Requirements

Here you can find the fundamental requirements to be satisfied by your agent.

#### 1. Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat Agent (Required)

Your agent **must** be hosted in **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**. This means your solution should be designed to run within the Copilot Chat experience, providing users with a seamless conversational interface integrated into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

**Important**: Your agent can target **Copilot Free** and does **not** necessarily require a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. This makes your solution accessible to a broader audience, including organizations that have not yet adopted paid Copilot licenses.

### Bonus Criteria (not mandatory)

If you want to get **extra points**, you can also support one or more of the following requirements.

#### 2. External MCP Server Integration (Optional)

Integrating your agent with an external **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** to read and write specific content is **optional but highly encouraged**. The MCP server acts as a bridge between your agent and external data sources or services, enabling your agent to:

- **Read Operations**: Retrieve data from external systems, databases, or APIs through the MCP server
- **Write Operations**: Create, update, or modify content in external systems through the MCP server

This demonstrates real-world integration capabilities and shows how your agent can interact with enterprise systems beyond the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

#### 3. OAuth Security for MCP Server (Optional)

Implementing **OAuth-based authentication and authorization** when consuming the MCP server will be **highly appreciated** and will positively impact your evaluation score. Secure MCP server integration should include:

- Proper OAuth 2.0 token acquisition and management
- Secure storage and handling of client credentials
- Token refresh mechanisms to maintain continuous access
- Proper error handling for authentication failures

#### 4. Adaptive Cards for UI/UX (Optional)

Using **Adaptive Cards** for rendering your agent's user interface and user experience will be considered a **plus** in your solution. Adaptive Cards provide:

- Rich, interactive card-based interfaces that render natively across Microsoft 365 applications
- Consistent user experiences across different platforms and devices
- Support for user input, actions, and dynamic content updates
- Accessibility features built into the card framework

Leverage Adaptive Cards to create engaging, intuitive interactions that enhance user productivity.
