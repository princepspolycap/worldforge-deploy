- Write comments like `// Create a particle system for visual effects` to generate code
- Begin a component with `const AnimatedCanvas = ({` to receive a complete implementation

Press `Tab` to accept suggestions or `Esc` to dismiss.

#### Natural Language Chat

Use natural language to interact with your codebase through the Chat view (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Shift+I`):

- "How does this animation loop work?"
- "What's causing the rendering issue in the draw function?"
- "Add sound effects when the user clicks the canvas"
- "Create a color palette generator component"

Learn more about [using chat in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat).

#### Autonomous Coding with Agents

Agents can autonomously plan and execute complex development tasks. Select **Agent** from the agent picker in the Chat view:

- "Implement a generative art canvas with multiple brush styles"
- "Create a music visualizer that responds to audio input"
- "Build a story generator with branching narrative paths"

The agent will iterate on the code, running commands and making coordinated changes across multiple files.

#### Inline Chat

For quick edits directly in the editor:

1. Select code and press `Ctrl+I` / `Cmd+I` to open inline chat
2. Ask Copilot to modify, refactor, or explain the selected code
3. Review and accept or reject proposed changes


### Understanding GitHub Copilot Modes

GitHub Copilot offers distinct modes, each designed to enhance your coding workflow in unique ways. Understanding when to use each mode will help you get the most out of Copilot for your creative projects:

#### Ask Mode

Ask Mode is a Q&A assistant that helps you understand code, solve problems, or learn concepts. It allows you to ask questions in natural language, and Copilot responds with explanations, snippets, or suggestions. It does not directly modify any code.

> **Tip**: Ask mode works best for quick clarifications, brainstorming creative solutions, and getting sample implementations for your project ideas.

**Example prompts for creative apps:**
- "How can I create a particle system effect in p5.js?"
- "What's the best approach for generating procedural music?"
- "Explain how color theory applies to generative art"

#### Edit Mode

Edit Mode enables direct code modifications based on natural language instructions. You can highlight specific code blocks or files, describe the desired changes, and Copilot will propose edits. These changes are presented as diffs for your review, ensuring you retain control over the final implementation.

> **Tip**: Try Edit mode for targeted updates, such as refactoring animation code or adding error handling to your creative application.

**Example prompts for creative apps:**
- "Add easing functions to this animation"
- "Refactor this drawing code to support multiple brush types"
- "Add input validation to the user prompt handler"

#### Agent Mode

Agent Mode is the most autonomous and powerful of the modes. It allows Copilot to analyze your entire project, plan tasks, make edits, run commands, and iterate until the goal is achieved. This mode is ideal for multi-step tasks, such as building features, fixing bugs, or scaffolding new components.

> **Tip**: Agent mode will carry out actions beyond just editing—it can write code, create new files, and run terminal commands. Best used for complex creative features that span multiple files.

**Example prompts for creative apps:**
- "Create a complete music visualizer component with audio analysis"
- "Build a story generator with save/load functionality and branching paths"
- "Implement a generative art canvas with multiple brush styles and export options"

#### Plan Mode

Plan Mode helps you outline your coding tasks and objectives more effectively. Copilot assists in creating a structured plan for your project, helping you break down complex creative tasks into manageable steps.

> **Tip**: Use Plan Mode when starting a new creative project to set clear objectives and receive tailored suggestions for your implementation approach.

**Example prompts for creative apps:**
- "Plan the architecture for an interactive fiction engine"
- "Help me break down building a procedural music generator"
- "Create a roadmap for implementing a collaborative art platform"

## ✨ Prompting Tips

Effective prompting is key to getting the most out of GitHub Copilot for creative development. Here are tips and techniques to improve your results:

<details>
<summary>💬 Prompting Techniques & Templates (click to expand)</summary>

### Use File References for Context

When working with GitHub Copilot Chat, use the `#file:filename` syntax to provide specific file context:

1. Type `#` in the Copilot chat window
2. A file picker will appear automatically
3. Select the file you want to reference
4. Then type or paste the rest of your prompt

**Example**: Instead of asking "add an animation function", ask "#file:canvas.js add a smooth easing animation function for the particle system"

### Be Specific About Creative Intent

Vague prompts lead to generic results. Include details about style, mood, and technical requirements:

| ❌ Vague Prompt | ✅ Specific Prompt |
|----------------|--------------------|
| "Generate some art" | "Create a generative art function that draws flowing curves using Perlin noise with a cool color palette" |
| "Make music" | "Generate a chord progression in C major with jazz voicings using Tone.js" |
| "Write a story" | "Create a branching narrative function that generates mystery story segments with 3 choices per scene" |

### Iterate Incrementally

For complex creative features, break your requests into smaller steps:

1. **Start with the foundation**: "Create a basic canvas setup with a render loop"
2. **Add core functionality**: "Add a particle class with position, velocity, and lifespan"
3. **Enhance with creativity**: "Make particles leave colorful trails that fade over time"
4. **Polish the experience**: "Add mouse interaction so particles are attracted to the cursor"

### Validate AI Suggestions

When Copilot generates creative code:

- **Test incrementally**: Run the code after each significant change to catch issues early
- **Trust but verify**: AI suggestions are starting points—review for correctness and style
- **Learn from output**: If a suggestion doesn't match your intent, refine your prompt with more context
- **Use Cheatsheets**: Keep reference documentation handy to validate generated code against known patterns

### Prompt Templates for Creative Apps

Here are reusable prompt patterns for common creative tasks:

**For Visual Effects:**
```
Create a [effect type] effect using [library/framework] that [behavior description]. 
The visual style should be [aesthetic description] with [color/mood] tones.
```

**For Generative Content:**
```
Build a [content type] generator that creates [output description] based on [input/parameters]. 
Include options for [customization options] and output in [format].
```

**For Interactive Experiences:**
```
Implement [interaction type] that responds to [user input]. 
When the user [action], the application should [response] with [feedback type].
```

### Using Inline Chat Effectively

For quick edits directly in the editor (`Ctrl+I` / `Cmd+I`):

- Select the specific code you want to modify before opening inline chat
- Use follow-up prompts to refine without rewriting the whole request
- Ask for explanations of generated code to understand the approach
