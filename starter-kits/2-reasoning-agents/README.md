## Project Ideas

In this track, we encourage you to create a multi-agent solution, using one of the following development approaches.

### Development Approaches

1. **Local development:** Build and test your custom agentic solution locally with the OSS [**Microsoft Agent Framework**](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) in Visual Studio Code.
1. **Cloud-based development:** Use [**Microsoft Foundry**](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry/) to orchestrate your reasoning agents in the Cloud. You can choose either a low-code/no-code approach - leveraging the [Foundry UI](https://ai.azure.com) to configure your agents and workflows - or a code-first approach - using the **Foundry Agent Service** within the [Foundry SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/sdk-overview) to build your agentic AI solution programmatically.

Whatever approach you choose, you are encouraged to:

- Leverage Microsoft Foundry-hosted, GitHub-hosted or locally-hosted AI models.
- Use visualizations and monitoring tools to track agent performance and interactions.
- Integrate with various data sources/APIs/MCP tools to enhance agent capabilities.
- Implement evaluation and deployment strategies for your multi-agent system.
- Leverage AI-assisted development tools to accelerate your build process (e.g. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)).

### Real-world Scenario

The goal of this track challenge is to build a multi-agent system that can effectively assist students in their preparation for Microsoft certification exams. The system should be capable of understanding the exam syllabus, generating study plans, providing practice questions, and offering feedback on performance.

Below is a suggested architecture for your multi-agent solution. Feel free to adapt and expand upon this architecture based on your creativity and technical skills.

![Reasoning Agents Architecture](./reasoning-agents-architecture.png)

In the above architecture:

1. The student inputs to the system the topics they wish to learn. This input is processed, so that the main information are extracted in a pre-defined structure and sent to a subworkflow of 3 sequential agents:
    - A *learning path curator* agent – suggesting a list of learning paths on Microsoft Learn relevant to the topics provided.
    - A *study plan generator* agent - converting the curated path into a tangible study plan and generating a timeline with milestones, suggested time allocations, and daily/weekly study sessions.
    - An *engagement* agent – setting up automated reminders to send to the student email to help them stay up to date with the study plan.
1. Once the subworkflow is executed, the system waits for a human input that confirms the student is ready to start an assessment.
1. Once the student confirms, the *assessment* agent generates an assessment to evaluate the student readiness.
1. If the student passes the test, then another agent suggests the relevant Microsoft certification to take and plans the exam. Otherwise, the system loops back into the preparation subworkflow.

> [!TIP]
> Some of the functionalities described in the architecture above can be implemented by integrating with the [Microsoft Learn MCP server](https://github.com/microsoftdocs/mcp). Learn more about it in the [Microsoft Learn MCP documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/support/mcp).

## 🧠 Reasoning Patterns & Best Practices

When designing your reasoning agents and multi-agent workflows, consider applying well-established reasoning patterns and agentic best practices to improve robustness, transparency, and outcomes.

### Common reasoning patterns to explore include:

1. **Planner–Executor:** Separate agents responsible for planning (breaking down the problem) and execution (carrying out tasks step by step).
1. **Critic / Verifier:** Introduce an agent that reviews outputs, checks assumptions, and validates reasoning before final responses are returned.
1. **Self-reflection & Iteration:** Allow agents to reflect on intermediate results and refine their approach when confidence is low or errors are detected.
1. **Role-based specialization:** Assign clear responsibilities to each agent to reduce overlap and improve reasoning quality.

### Best practices for building with Microsoft Foundry:

1. Use **telemetry**, logs, and visual workflows in Foundry to understand how agents reason and collaborate.
    - Explore Foundry built-in monitoring tools to track agent interactions and performance: [Foundry Control Plane](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/control-plane/overview?view=foundry)
1. Apply **evaluation** strategies (e.g., test cases, scoring rubrics, or human-in-the-loop reviews) to continuously improve agent behavior.

# .env (add to .gitignore immediately!)
AZURE_AI_PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING=your-connection-string
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-subscription-id
```

✅ **Use Azure Key Vault** - For production apps, store secrets in Azure Key Vault:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = SecretClient(vault_url="https://your-vault.vault.azure.net/", credential=credential)
api_key = client.get_secret("openai-api-key").value
```

✅ **Enable Managed Identities** - Use Azure Managed Identities to authenticate without storing credentials

✅ **Review `.gitignore`** - Ensure these patterns are included:

```gitignore
.env
.env.*
.azure/
**/.secrets/
config/secrets.*
*.pem
*.key
```

✅ **Use demo data only** - Never use real customer data or production datasets

✅ **Scan for secrets** - Run secret detection before pushing:

```bash
# Install and use git-secrets
git secrets --scan
```
